## Why This Exists

This site is a personal technical reference — a searchable archive of code snippets,
write-ups, and notes from software engineering work.

## Stack

- **Hugo** with the PaperMod theme
- **GitHub Pages** with custom domain
- **JSON-LD** structured data for search engines

## What to Expect

Short code snippets and longer technical write-ups, organized by tags and searchable.
